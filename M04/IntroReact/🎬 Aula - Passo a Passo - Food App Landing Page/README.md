# Food App Project 

## This is a default landing page for a Food App Project made using these following technologies:

- ### HTML
- ### CSS
- ### ReactJS
- ### NodeJS
- ### Vercel

The idea is to push myself further into using componentization in order to create dynamic webpages that can escalate with organization. 

## Main Concepts Developed
    - Componentization
    - JS/JSX Modules
    - CSS Modules
    - Responsiveness
    - Deployment

### Notes

1. Responsiveness wasn't done all the way through so expect some inconsistencies while decreasing the width

2. Form is merely aesthetic 

3. Restaurant names were invented for the sake of the project, so if by any chance that there's a restaurant with this name, it is just coincidence
